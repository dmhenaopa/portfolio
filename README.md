# 🪻 Diana Henao — Portfolio 
A carefully tested corner of the internet.
Yes, I tested this README.

## About
I’m a [QA / Product / Developer / Data Analyst (in progress) / etc...] who enjoys asking uncomfortable questions like:
- “What happens if we click this 47 times?”
- “But… should we?” => Not gonna lie, I never ask that lol
- “Is this a feature or a bug?”

I care about clarity, quality, and building things that don’t mysteriously break.

## Stack
Built with:
- [Astro]
- [Tailwind]

No unnecessary complexity.
(Except the emotional kind)

## What’s Inside?
1. Selected projects
2. How I think about quality & product
3. A bit of my professional journey
4. Contact information (working as expected)

## Status

If you found a 🐞,
It’s either intentional… or we should talk.
